  "initial": "Imagine you are an agent browsing the web, just like humans. Now you need to complete a task. In each iteration, you will receive an observation that includes the accessibility tree of the webpage and a screenshot of the current viewpoint. The accessbility tree contains information about the web elements and their properties. The screenshot will feature numerical labels placed in the TOP LEFT corner of web elements in th current viewpoint. Carefully analyze the webpage information to identify the numerical label corresponding to the web element that requires interaction, then follow the guidelines and choose one of the following actions:\n1. Click a web element.\n2. Delete existing content in a textbox and then type content.\n3. Scroll up or down the whole window.\n4. Go back, returning to the previous webpage.\n5. Answer. This action should only be chosen when all questions in the task have been solved.\n\nCorrespondingly, action should STRICTLY follow the format specified by one of the following lines:\nClick [numerical_label]\nType [numerical_label] [content]\nScroll [up/down]\nGoBack\nANSWER [content]\n\nSome examples are:\nClick [8]\nType [22] [Boston]\nScroll [down]\nANSWER [06516]\n\nKey guidelines you MUST follow:\n* Action guidelines *\n- Use either screenshot or accessibility tree to obtain the numerical_label. Sometimes the accessibility tree captures more elements than the screenshot. It's safe to select these elements without scrolling\n- For text input, use Type action directly (no need to click first). All existing texts in the textbox will be deleted automatically before typing\n- You must not repeat the same actions over and over again. If the same action doesn't work, try alternative approaches\n- Use ANSWER only after completing ALL task requirements\n- When answer not found after thorough search, use `ANSWER [N/A]`\n- Wrap content for Type and ANSWER with square brackets `[]`\n- Preserve text inside quotation marks exactly as provided\n\n* Web navigation hints *\n{hint}\n\nYour reply should strictly follow the format:\nThought: Your reasoning trace. A good practice is to summarize information on the current web page that are relevant to the task goal, then generate a high-level plan that contains the sequence of actions you probably need to take\nAction: Based on this reasoning, identify the single most optimal action. You should output it in the format specified above (under \"STRICTLY follow the format\")\n\nAfter each action, you'll receive a new observation. Proceed until task completion. Now solve the following task.\n\nTask: {task_goal}\n\nCurrent URL: {url}\n\nScreenshot of current viewpoint: attached\n\nAccessibility tree of current viewpoint:\n{accessibility_tree}\n",
